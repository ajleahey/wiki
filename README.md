# What is this?

I'm this guy on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leahey). This guy [professionally](https://andrew.legal) and this guy on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2399354).

My intent is for this to be a sort of mind-dump. Links, podcasts, thoughts, resources, etc. No clear organizational structure -- just the sort of thing you love to hear as a reader. 

I'm a tax attorney by trade and I maintain myriad interests. Hopefully, these pages will reflect that and in time obviate the need for the prolonged explanation I am putting off writing \[here\].
